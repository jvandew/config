# config

The setup script here should be considered deprecated. I originally attempted to check in and
manage configs for applications and macOs plists (Sublime Test, Terminal, etc) here, but suspect
there is enough drift over time to make that a fool's errand. There are some application configs
provided for reference, but they should not be assumed up to date and I would generally be
terrified to copy them unmodified to a modern macOS install.

In general though, I set up new machines that want a uniform configuration rarely enough that it is
just not worth the effort of maintaining an automated setup here. Maybe that will change one day.
